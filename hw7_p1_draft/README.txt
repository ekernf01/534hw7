README

I made my modifications in main, regmodels.cpp and regmodels.h. All necessary files
are included; you should be able to simply run these commands to compile and run.
>>> make
>>> ./regressions

The results, piped to "regressions1-2.txt", should show the top ten single-variable regressions as this.
-59.31620	2	2	11
-61.90744	2	2	10
-64.10455	2	2	43
-65.39395	2	2	15
-65.65311	2	2	24
-66.28088	2	2	34
-67.32217	2	2	12
-67.91884	2	2	8
-68.30237	2	2	33
-69.57794	2	4	24

The output to the terminal for problem two is a big mess of add and delete notifications since I added some sanity-check statements upon deleting a regression.
